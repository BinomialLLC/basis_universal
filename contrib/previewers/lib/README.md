# Single File Basis Universal Transcoder

Header and implementation generated using the [single file transcoder](../../single_file_transcoder) post-process script. Unlike the examples in that subproject here the transcoder header was kept as a seperate file (using the `-k` option, see the [README](../../single_file_transcoder/README.md)).
