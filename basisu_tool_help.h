"--- Intro:\n"
"\n"
"This tool compresses LDR/SDR and HDR images and textures to a Basis Universal\n"
"supercompressed GPU texture, which can be written to supercompressed .basis or\n"
"standard .KTX2 files. It supports a number of SDR and HDR codecs, each with\n"
"different quality, transcoding performance, and bitrate tradeoffs. A SDR/HDR\n"
"mipmap generator is also included. This tool can also examine and\n"
"unpack .KTX2/.basis files to .PNG, .KTX (v1), .ASTC, or .DDS files using its\n"
"single source file transcoder library.\n"
"\n"
"The list of supported texture/supercompressed texture codecs:\n"
" -LDR: ETC1S (SDR default), RDO UASTC LDR 4x4, ASTC or XUASTC LDR 4x4-12x12\n"
" -HDR: UASTC HDR 4x4 (HDR default), RDO ASTC HDR 6x6, UASTC HDR 6x6\n"
" \n"
"RDO=Rate-Distortion Optimization. Two key parameters (quality and effort) have\n"
"been unified across all the codecs:\n"
"\n"
"- The -quality X parameter, where X ranges from [0, 100], controls the\n"
"compression quality vs. bitrate (output file size) tradeoff for those codecs\n"
"supporting supercompression or RDO (Rate-distortion optimization). 100=max\n"
"quality, and lower levels produce smaller files with more distortion.\n"
"\n"
"- The -effort X parameter, where X ranges from [0, 10], controls the\n"
"compression speed (and max CPU usage) vs. max achievable quality tradeoff.\n"
"Low efforts result in more distortion/artifacts, but faster compression. Lower\n"
"efforts result in less utilization of the underlying GPU block format's\n"
"capabilities.\n"
"\n"
"Key Definitions: \n"
"\"Quality\" controls the explicit tradeoff between output distortion and output\n"
"file bitrate (in bits per pixel or target). At max quality (100) each\n"
"compressor will output the lowest distortion it's capable of at its currently\n"
"configured effort level.\n"
"\n"
"\"Effort\" controls how intensely a compressor uses the CPU to focus on each\n"
"block format's encoding capabilities. Low effort levels only target a set of\n"
"core or basic capabilities (specific to each output target format), while\n"
"higher effort levels allow each compressor to explore more of each target's\n"
"features (at the cost of higher CPU time). Lower effort levels result in more\n"
"brittle compression (higher distortion on tough image/texture features).\n"
"Effort=0 fastest compression, effort=10=extremely slow.\n"
"\n"
"Unless an explicit mode is specified, if one or more files have the .basis\n"
"or .KTX2 extension this tool defaults to unpack mode.\n"
"\n"
"By default, the compressor assumes the input is in the sRGB colorspace (like\n"
"typical photos/albedo textures). If the input is NOT sRGB (like a normal map),\n"
"be sure to specify -linear for less artifacts. Depending on the content type,\n"
"some experimentation may be needed.\n"
"\n"
"The TinyEXR library is used to read .EXR images. Crucially, this small library\n"
"does not support all .EXR compression methods. For unsupported images, you can\n"
"use a tool like ImageMagick to convert them to uncompressed .EXR.\n"
"\n"
"For .DDS source files: Mipmapped or plain 2D textures (but not cubemaps) are\n"
"supported. Only uncompressed 32-bit RGBA/BGRA, half float RGBA, or float\n"
"RGBA .DDS files are supported. In -tex_array mode, if a .DDS file is specified,\n"
"all source files must be in .DDS format.\n"
"\n"
"Filenames prefixed with a @ symbol are read as filename listing files. Listing\n"
"text files specify which actual filenames to process (one filename per line).\n"
"\n"
"--- High-Level Texture Mode (Codec) Selection:\n"
"\n"
" 1. -etc1s: Encode to supercompressed ETC1S LDR (the default for SDR/LDR\n"

"    Output is standard, but constrained, ASTC HDR 4x4. Roughly 5-8 bpp. In this\n"

"\n"
" 4. -hdr_6x6: ASTC HDR 6x6. Encode input as RDO or highest quality standard\n"

"--- Tool Options:\n"
"\n"
" -ktx2: Write .KTX2 files (the default). By default, UASTC LDR/HDR 4x4 and ASTC\n"

"  specified.\n"
"\n"
" -basis: Write .basis files instead of .KTX2 files.\n"
"\n"
" -file filename.png/tga/jpg/qoi/exr/hdr: Input image filename, multiple images\n"

"  with -file is optional)\n"
"\n"
" -alpha_file filename.png/tga/jpg/qoi: Input alpha image filename, multiple\n"

"  as of v1.16)\n"
"\n"
" -parallel: Compress multiple textures simultaneously (one per thread), instead\n"
"  of one at a time. Compatible with OpenCL mode. This is much faster, but in\n"
"  OpenCL mode the driver is pushed harder, and the CLI output will be jumbled.\n"
"\n"
" -linear: Use linear colorspace metrics (instead of the default sRGB or scaled\n"
"  RGB for HDR), write linear transfer function setting to KTX2/basis file, and\n"

"\n"
" -comp_level X: Low-level ETC1S speed vs. quality tradeoff. Range is 0-6,\n"
